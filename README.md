# 📊 Insurance Agency Performance Analysis

## Project Objective

The objective of this project is to analyze the performance of an insurance agency using a **simulated dataset** that represents realistic business operations.
The analysis focuses on understanding **sales trends**, **marketing efficiency**, and **customer retention**, and demonstrates how data analysis can support data-driven business decisions.

This project was created as a **portfolio project** to showcase skills in data analysis, SQL, and data visualization using tools commonly required in data analyst roles.

## Business Questions

This analysis aims to answer the following key questions:

* Which agents and states are the **top performers** in terms of policy sales and premium revenue?
* Which **marketing channels provide the highest return on investment (ROI)**?
* How do **policy sales and premium revenue evolve over time**?
* What is the relationship between **acquisition cost and customer retention**?
* Are higher acquisition costs associated with better retention outcomes?

## Dataset Overview

The dataset used in this project is **simulated** and was intentionally designed to mimic real insurance agency data.

**Columns included:**

* `Agent_ID` – Unique identifier for each insurance agent
* `State` – State where the agent operates
* `Policies_Sold` – Number of insurance policies sold
* `Premium_Amount` – Total premium revenue generated
* `Marketing_Channel` – Channel used to acquire customers
* `Acquisition_Cost` – Cost of acquiring customers
* `Retention_Rate` – Percentage of retained customers
* `Month` – Month of the transaction
* `ROI` – Return on investment (calculated metric)

Although the data is not real, it reflects realistic relationships between marketing spend, retention, and revenue.

* **TV advertising** has the highest acquisition costs and lower ROI, indicating potential inefficiencies.
* **Digital Ads and Social Media** provide moderate ROI and are effective for scalable growth.
* **Policy sales remain relatively stable over time**, suggesting consistent demand.

## Notes

This project uses a **simulated dataset**, which is a common and accepted practice for portfolio projects. The primary goal is to demonstrate **analytical thinking, data handling, and communication skills**, rather than to analyze proprietary or real-world data.
